Some update from deshana for the web page are included here.  She will be sending a picture of her and Trisha in the future too.  

I would like to continue a heading for Services: then put in those listed on the web page and the nail surgery pricing there and the orthotic pricing.   For the orthotics write: Orthotics (custom foot supports) - in office measurements and plaster slipper cast impressions of the feet.   Price $325.

I think we talked about putting the contact information up front on web page.
